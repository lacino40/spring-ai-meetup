## Description

This project is a demonstration of integrating **Spring AI** capabilities within a Spring-based application.

## Features

- ### Prompt 
  The **Prompt** allows to input dynamic prompts or messages that are processed to generate relevant AI-driven responses. 

- ### Prompt stuffing
  **Prompt stuffing** involves combining multiple pieces of information into a single prompt to provide the AI with richer 
context for generating more accurate and relevant responses.

- ### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  **RAG** combines the power of information retrieval with AI-generated responses to enhance relevance of outputs. By 
integrating a vector database, the AI can retrieve relevant context or knowledge and seamlessly incorporate it into 
responses.

- ### Functions
  The **functions** feature enables structured interactions by allowing developers to define specific functions that 
the AI can call during a conversation.

- ### Audio Text-to-Speech (TTS)
  Converts user-provided text into natural-sounding audio.

- ### Image generation
  Allows users to input descriptive prompts, generating unique and custom AI-driven images dynamically.

- ### Multi AI model integration 
  Showcases the use of multiple AI models - **OpenAI** and **Ollama** - within a single application.

## Setup and Usage
### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements
- `Java Development Kit (JDK) version 21` or later
- `openai.key` **(mandatory)** - is a key used to authenticate requests to OpenAI's API
- `service.weather.open-weather.api-key` **(optional)** - is a key that stores the unique API key required to access data from the
  OpenWeatherMap API.

To generate and obtain `openai.key` API key:
1. Visit [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/) and log in with your credentials. If you donâ€™t have an account, create one by signing up.
2. Navigate to your account settings by clicking on your profile icon in the top right corner. Select **"API Keys"** from the dropdown menu or go directly to the [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
3. Click on the **"Create new secret key"** button. A dialog box will appear with your newly generated API key. **Copy this key immediately**, as you will not be able to view it again later.
4. Add the copied API key to configuration as required

To generate and obtain `service.weather.open-weather.api-key` API key:
1. Visit the OpenWeatherMap website at https://openweathermap.org/
2. Create an account or log in if you already have an account
3. On successful login, navigate to the `My API Keys` menu in the account settings.
4. You will see your unique API Key, or you can generate a new one if you prefer. This key is alphanumeric.

However, if `service.weather.open-weather.api-key` is not provided or invalid, the weather service has fail-safe
mechanism implemented. It will fall back to use mock data for weather information. This mock data is stored in a file
named `open-weather-mock.json`, which is part of application's resources. This file contains pre-set, static weather
data.
