## Description

This project is a demonstration of integrating **Spring AI** capabilities within a Spring-based application.

## Features

### Prompt
The **Prompt** allows to input dynamic prompts or messages that are processed to generate relevant AI-driven responses. 

### Prompt stuffing
**Prompt stuffing** involves combining multiple pieces of information into a single prompt to provide the AI with richer 
context for generating more accurate and relevant responses.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**RAG** combines the power of information retrieval with AI-generated responses to enhance relevance of outputs. By 
integrating a vector database, the AI can retrieve relevant context or knowledge and seamlessly incorporate it into 
responses.

### Functions
The **functions** feature enables structured interactions by allowing developers to define specific functions that 
the AI can call during a conversation.

### Audio Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Converts user-provided text into natural-sounding audio.

### Image generation
Allows users to input descriptive prompts, generating unique and custom AI-driven images dynamically

### Multi AI model integration 
Showcases the use of multiple AI models - **OpenAI** and **Ollama** - within a single application.
